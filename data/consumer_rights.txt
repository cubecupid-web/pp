Your Rights as a Consumer

When you buy a product, you have the right to quality, safety, and correct information. If you buy a product and it is defective or fake, you can file a complaint. First, contact the seller for a refund or replacement. If they do not help, you can file a complaint at the online National Consumer Helpline (NCH). Always keep your bill and any messages with the seller.
